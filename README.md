Some tips on how to survive a mental health crisis as a software engineer in the US (advice particularly helpful for those also at Microsoft) based on my own personal experience.

# It's a medical issue
Mental health is a physical health issue; it's biochemistry. All the peer reviewed medical literature knows this -- but, if you really want to be reticient about it, it's also anecdotally well supported by the reality that my symptoms improved dramatically after finding a very specific combination of medication. It's just brain chemistry. It is. Unfortunately, that doesn't mean everyone is understanding of mental health issues (take one look at the recent public reaction to Simone Biles' Olympic decision.) It also doesn't mean that you'll find it easy, nor shameless, to reach out for help; asking for help is exhausting, something that's particularly hard to do when you already have no feelings or energy or motivation.
